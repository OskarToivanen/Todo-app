Key features of the app include:

Frontend: The user interface is built using React and TypeScript, ensuring a robust and type-safe development experience. Material-UI is used for styling and creating a modern and responsive layout.

Backend: The server-side logic is implemented using Express and hosted in Heroku, which provides an API to interact with the MongoDB database. The API exposes endpoints to perform CRUD operations on the todo items.

Database: MongoDB is used as the database to store the todo items. Each item consists of a title, description, completion status, and creation date.

Functionality: The app allows users to add new tasks with a title and an optional description. The tasks can be marked as completed by checking the checkbox next to each item. Users can also update the title and description of a task by double-clicking on it and saving the changes. Tasks can be deleted using the delete button next to each item.

Overall, this Todo app serves as a simple and effective task management tool, showcasing the integration of various web technologies to create a full-stack application.
